# ft_printf
ft_printf is reproduced C's printf function. Just like real printf, it allows the following functionality:

```
%[flags][width][length]type 
```

Result is a formated string. Each of these parts is explained below.
To produce ft_printf() function, only UNIX write, malloc, free, exit, stdarg functions have been used. Rest of the functionality is custom built.

## Project folder structure
```
ft_printf
â”œâ”€â”€ [header file for project]
â””â”€â”€ [source files of the project]
Makefile [compiles the project]
```

## Getting Started

Run **make**, which results in library called libftprintf.a. In your source file, use ft_printf() function just as you would use printf(). Furthermore, compile your source code with libftprintf.a to use ft_printf() function. So libftprint.a includes the ft_printf() function.

```
cc main.c libftprintf.a
```
## Functionality
### [flags]

Following flags are supported
```
'#'(hash) - For o, x, X types, the text 0, 0x, 0X, respectively, is prepended to non-zero numbers.

'+'(plus) - Prepends a plus for positive signed-numeric types.

' '(space) - Prepends a space for positive signed-numeric types.This flag is ignored if the + flag exists.
```

### [width]
Width specifies a minimum number of characters to output.
For example, ft_printf("%5d", 5); would result in '    5';

### [length]
Length specifiers tell what argument is expected. It will cause ft_printf() to typecast the input
to meet necessary requirement.

### type
Following conversion characters are allowed:

```
%c (character)
%s (string)
%p (address)
%d (digit)
%i (integer)
%o (digit in octal)
%u (unsigned integer)
%x (hexadecimal in lowercase)
%X (hexadecimal in upper case)
%f (float)
```
Furthermore, ft_printf supports multibyte characters. For multibyte character argument must have L in front of it indicating that it consists of wide characters. If multibyte character or string are printed, their respective conversion character has to be in capital. For example, to print 'â†’' character, %c becomes %C. If you wish, you can also print emojis.
```
ft_printf("%C", L'â†’'); Outputs 'â†’'.
ft_printf("%C", L'ðŸ˜Š'); Outputs 'ðŸ˜Š'

```
## Return value
Function returns bytes written to standard output. Thus, if multibyte character is printed, ft_printf() would return the amount of bytes it consists of not how many characters were printed.
```
